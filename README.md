- Copy the "Raw Filters" section from > [This Website](https://git-pikakid98.github.io/other/decluttertube) < (Psst. Blue text means you can click it)
- Then simply copy and paste them into the box. Please be aware that some filters are completely optional. Look below to see which filters you want

## What even are these filters?

`30dollarstudiohaircut` DON'T YOU LECTURE ME WITH YOUR 30 DOLLAR HAIRCUT!! Removes pointless notifications from YouTube Studio

`CategorizeThis` Removes the categories from YouTube (This unfortunately also breaks the newest and oldest section on channels)

`CleanSideBar` Cleans pointless categories from the YouTube sidebar

`DONTHitTheBell` Removes all of the "Bell notifcation options" from the subscribe dropdown
\
Warning: This filter currently causes playlist features to go missing. I'm finding a way to fix this

`FeatureCreep` Removes all of the "Bell notifcation options" from the subscribe dropdown

`IJustWannaJam` Removes pointless fluff from YouTube Music

`MinorInconvenience` Removes the sidebar preview on the homepage

`MyCountryisNunyaBizniss` Removes the country code (Completely optional)

`NobodyCaresIfYoureLive` Removes "Live badge" from the subscription section

`NoMoreShorts` Remove the annoying shorts tabs on the home menu and the recommended videos

`NoThanks.IPreferVideos` Removes the Releases and Podcasts tab from YouTube Channels
\
Warning: This filter acts differently on different channels for some reason, In some cases it hides Playlists and the About section. I'm currently trying to find a way around this

`WhatDoAnyOfTheseDo` Removes all of the pointless buttons on videos like share, the (now pointless) dislike button etc.

`GiveEmAShot` Removes "Live" tag, Verification ticks and view counts, like counts and sub counts to encorage people to check out smaller creators without YouTube's brainwashing "High view count = good content" mentality

`IDontNeedNoHelp` Removes the help and feedback options from YouTube and YouTube Studio

`NoDollarYT` Removes the join button and member badges (Doesn't affect live chat and chat replay due to how they work)

`NoShortsTitleSuggestions` Removes the hashtag suggestions from the title bar in YouTube Studio

`NoEmailLeak` Useful for livestreamers who are worried about clicking on something and accidentally leaking their email to the internet

`NoKappa` Hides livestream chat and chat replays for stream VODs and premieres

Please be aware that some of these filters may be broken or contain duplicate filters. I'll fix these as soon as I find them or they get reported
